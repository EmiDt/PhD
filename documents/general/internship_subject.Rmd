Characterizing biological diversity, or so-called biodiversity, and understanding its causes and consequences have been central to the development of ecology and evolution [@Messier2010]. Biodiversity can be divided in three fundamental categories: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity encompasses the range of terrestrial and aquatic environments found on earth classified into ecosystems. Ecosystems encompass both the biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Moreover, ecosystems harbour groups of interacting organisms, defined as species, which together represent the species diversity component of biodiversity. Species has been defined as group of organisms which are reproducing isolated from each other, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. But species concept and definition has been largely debated, and many species concepts can be defined (phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic, see @DeQueiroz2007). Individuals within species present variation in performance, phenotypes, and genes, which represents genetic diversity. Tropical rainforests are one constituent of the ecosystem diversity. The outstanding biodiversity of tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists (Connell 1978). Different theories have been developed to explain the persistence of different species in sympatry. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. But forest trees are competing for a small number of resources (water, light and several nutrients). Consequently depending on the level of competition between species, competition should be responsible for a low number of species. Some studies argue that intraspecific variability play a role in answering this paradox and thus responsible for the maintenance of high species diversity [@Chesson2000a; @Clark2010]: variations among individuals within species allow species to differ in their distribution responses to the environment, and thus to adapt to finely strsuctured habitats. Consequently, we are interested in the role of intraspecific variability in species population structure in relation to their environment.

More and more litterature advocate for the use of functional ecology, and more especially trait-based study [@ackerly_trait-based_2007; @Escudero2016; @Levine2015; @Messier2010]. Functional traits are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits impacting fitness indirectly through their effect on individual performance, composed of growth, reproduction, and survival [@violle_let_2007]. Consequently, functional traits appear to be a perfect tool to study the question of the role of intraspecific variability in species population structure in relation to their environment. Moreover, litterature recently highlighted the lack of importance given to intraspecific variance in functional and community ecology, and advocated to integrate it in further studies [@Albert2011a; @Albert2015; @Messier2010; @Siefert2015a; @Violle2012]. Consequently we propose to study variations among individuals with a trait-based approach focusing on intraspecific trait variability (ITV).

The study will focus on the hyperdominant and widespread *Symlphonia globulifera* species. In french Guiana this species present two morphotypes, *S. globulifera* and *S sp.1*, living in sympatry but in apparently differentiated habitats. Tissue materials (leaf and wood) will be collected before the internship on both morphotypes on 400 individuals monitored in the Paracou research station for over 20 years. Fresh measurement will be done directly on the field during the dry season before the beginning of the internship. The first step will be to realize leaf and wood dry measurements and image analysis on collected tissue materials using standard protocols [@perez-harguindeguy_new_2013]. Then the candidate will pursue with strong data analysis to study intraspecific trait variability structuration into the species complex in relation to the environment. The results will be important for the understanding of the functional structuration of *Symphonia* complex with its environment, and more generally for insights on the role of intraspecific trait variability (ITV). We seek for a highly motivated master candidate who is eager to acquire experience in trait measurement, data analysis, functional and trait-based ecology.
