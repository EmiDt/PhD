## Ecological genomics of niche exploitation and individual performance in tropical forest trees

The outstanding biodiversity of tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists  [@connell_diversity_1978]. Different theories have been developed to  to explain the persistence of different species in sympatry. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of  stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001].

However, models of community dynamics cannot explain the maintenance of biodiversity in the long term because they consider all members of a species as equivalent, thus ignoring the component of within-species biodiversity [@Albert2011; @Chesson2000; @laughlin_predictive_2012; @Snell2014; @Bec2015]. Effectively, some studies argue that intraspecific variability is necessary for the maintenance of species diversity in communities [@Chesson2000; @Clark2010]. Indeed, the past and current evolutionary processes determining the genesis, the maintenance and the evolution of these hyper diverse ecosystems are not well understood [@Plana2004]. Trees evolutionary patterns present a paradox: tree lineages maintain high diversity while keeping a low speciation rate [@Petit2006]. This paradox is related to tropical tree great size, longevity, and numerous seeds, along with large effective population [@Brown2004] outcrossing mating system and maintaining a strong gene flow [@Hamrick1992; @Nybom2004]. Thus, neutral processes maintain diversity over time by connecting species with high gene flow and large effective population, while adaptive processes lead to local adaptation on short times with an expected  genetic differentiation at the loci underlying heritable traits [@Howe2003; @LeCorre2003].

Therefore, intraspecific variability seems highly important in species rich ecosystems such as tropical forests [@TerSteege2013]. Indeed tropical forests present both clades with huge variation in varied habitats [@Brousseau2015; @Torroba-Balmori2017], and closely related species living in sympatry that frequently share alleles [@Gonzalez2009; @Parmentier2013]. Species that share alleles frequently can be considered as belonging to species complexes, which largely share genetic variation because of hybridization of common ancestry but where divergent selection favours differential niche adaptation. 

In this thesis, we want to investigate *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera* species complexes at the individual level to better understand the importance of intraspecific variation into species maintenance and diversification. These genera were chosen because they are ecologically important, common genera in neotropical rain forests [@Dick2008; @Mori1990; @Mori2016; @TerSteege2013] that show, respectively, sympatric ecotypes and multiple sympatric species in rainforests of the Guiana Shield [@Molino2001]. For both genera, genetic information is already available [@Carneiro2009; @Dick2008; @Gonzalez2009a; @Olsson2017; @Torroba-Balmori2017] and Heuertz et al. unpublished data. We want to use genetic markers to characterize each individual and investigate the roles of environment and genotype in explaining individual functional traits, and ultimately, growth performance. We hope to relate genes to performance in individualsâ€™ specific environments to better predict growth at the individual level and understand the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in species complexes.

We will collect tissue materials on *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera* trees monitored in the Paracou research station for over 20 years from  genera. We plan to use genome scans to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We will measure inter-individual genetic distances based on SNPs and test *in situ* association of SNPs with growth, functional traits, or habitats to identify alleles with a significant effect on the trait of interest [@Budde2014]. In parallel, we want to build growth models relating  annual growth rate (AGR) in each species complex (*Symphonia* or *Eschweilera*) to the diameter at breast height (dbh) as a first model (M0). We wish to add habitat and/or environmental effects (Me) and conspecific tree neighborhood effect (Mn) to the previous model. Finally, we want to add genetic effects to the model through the inter-individual genetic distance matrix (Mg) and identified loci of interest (Ml). We will also explore models of polygenic adaptation to identify groups of loci with a joint effect on phenotypes, and to partition the phenotypic variance into neutral and adaptive genetic effects [@Berg2014]. We finally hope to cross models to select the one with the best tradeoff between convergence, complexity (number of parameters), likelihood and prediction quality.

We thus want to test if closely related species or sub-specific clades locally exploit different habitats due to functional adaptation resulting from evolution from a common genetic basis. Additionally, we wish to show the importance of hybridization as a driving force of adaptive evolution. Finally, we hope to improve growth models with intraspecific variation through genetic and functional data  at the individual level.
