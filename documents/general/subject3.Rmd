# Introduction

Characterizing biological diversity, or so-called biodiversity, and understanding its causes and consequences have been central to the development of ecology and evolution [@Messier2010]. Three simple questions arise from this statement: (1) what is biodiversity, (2) what is the cause of its existence, (3) and what are the consequences of its existence. Characterizing biodiversity is a *sine qua non* condition to embrace the two following questions. Once the biodiversity is characterised we can study its causes. But biodiversity is dynamic, so we can study its origin, maintenance, and future, or more generally how it evolves. Once biodiversity is characterised, we can also study consequences of its existence. But this a different question which will not be addressed here despite a huge litterature around the question [@Cardinale2012; @diaz_biodiversity_2006; @Liang2016; @Loreau2000; @Naeem2002; @Oliver2015; @Yachi1999].

_**What is biodiversity ?**_

Biodiversity, or biological diversity, can be divided in three fundamental categories: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity encompass the range of terrestrial and aquatic environements found on earth classified into ecosystems. Ecosystems encompass both the biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Moreover, species diversity represents species in which are categorized the interacting organisms of the ecosystem. Species has been defined as group of organims which are reproducing isolated from each other, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. But species concept and defintion has been largely debated [@Mayden1997], and many species concepts can be defined (phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic, see @DeQueiroz2007). However, indivduals presents variations in performance, phenotypes, and genes within species itself representing genetic diversity.

_**What is the cause of biodiversity existence ?**_

Earth present a lagre amount of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Among theim, the outstanding biodiversity of coral reefs and tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists [@connell_diversity_1978]. At the species level, different theories have been developed to explain the persistence of biodiversity. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. But numerous theories exists [@wright2002plant]. Still, theories often ignore genetic biodiversity represented by intraspecific variability arising from indivdual diversity inside populations and communities. Yet, numerous studies have shown that (i) intraspecific variation is high [@Messier2010; @Vieilledent2010], (ii) intraspecific variation play an important role at population and community level [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @Albert2015; @Messier2010], (iii) intraspecific variation can answer paradox of species coexistence [@Laughlin2012], and (iv) intraspecific variation is needed to understand maintenance of species coexistence [@chave_neutral_2004; @Chesson2000a; @Clark2007; @Clark2010; @Violle2012] and therefore is a cause of biodiversity existence.

Consequently, we want to further reintroduce intraspecific variation in ecology and evolution in order to participate to the question of biodiversity characteristics and causes at the genetic level starting from an integrative model of the individual functionement inside its population and its environment mixing ecology through individual interactions with environment and other individuals and evolution through evolution of the population through time based on a litterature review. We want this time to have a Bottom Up study instead of classical TopDown studies, because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environement are ultimately based at the level of individuals, it makes sense to build a theory of community ecology starting with individuals [@Violle2012]. **I know it is unreadable it just to "let the flow out".**

# Individual level

If we a consider a mature individual tree *A*. It will be constituted of a genome with different genes ($G_1,...G_I$). Part of the genome will be expressed in the transcriptome depending on individual ontogeny and environmental conditions. **Look into this.** Then those transcripts will be responsible for the creation of molecules forming biochemistrial traits of the individual. This basic functional traits can be considered as primary traits. Interactions in individuals biochemistrial traits will then build individual physiological and morphological traits. All functional traits, among biochemistry, physiolgy and morphology, finally influence integrative traits represented by performance traits directing playing on individual fitness. Perfomance traits are growth, reproduction and survival. Fitness (**define fitness**) of the individual will then result in the balance of those three performance traits (**add example of opposite trade-offs**). But all those step resulting in individual fitness through genes, traits and performance are influenced by their local environment. Local environment is both abiotic (nutrients, water, light...) and biotic (competition, predation). And local environment interpaly with individuals processes at different levels. **E => G ?**. Local environment may change functional traits values with phenotypic plasticity (**Litterature**). **E => P ?**. Consequently local environment affect individual fitness.
