# Introduction

Characterizing biological diversity, or so-called biodiversity, and understanding its causes and consequences have been central to the development of ecology and evolution [@Messier2010]. Three simple questions arise from this statement: (1) what is biodiversity, (2) what is the cause of its existence, (3) and what are the consequences of its existence. Characterizing biodiversity is a *sine qua non* condition to embrace the two following questions. Once the biodiversity is characterised we can study its causes. But biodiversity is dynamic, so we can study its origin, maintenance, and future, or more generally how it evolves. Once biodiversity is characterised, we can also study consequences of its existence. But this is a different question which will not be addressed here despite a huge litterature around the question [@Cardinale2012; @diaz_biodiversity_2006; @Liang2016; @Loreau2000; @Naeem2002; @Oliver2015; @Yachi1999].

_**What is biodiversity ?**_

Biodiversity can be divided in three fundamental categories: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity encompass the range of terrestrial and aquatic environements found on earth classified into ecosystems. Ecosystems encompass both the biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Moreover, species diversity represents species in which are categorized the interacting organisms of the ecosystem. Species have been defined as groups of organims which are reproducing isolated from other such groups, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. This reflects the biological species concept based on reproductive isolation. But species concepts and defintions have been largely debated [@Mayden1997], especially concerning plants, and many species concepts can be defined (phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic, see @DeQueiroz2007). However, indivduals presents variations in performance, phenotypes, and genes within species itself representing genetic diversity.

_**What is the cause of biodiversity existence ?**_

Earth present a lagre amount of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Among theim, the outstanding biodiversity of coral reefs and tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists [@connell_diversity_1978]. At the species level, different theories have been developed to explain the persistence of biodiversity. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. But numerous theories exists [@wright2002plant]. Still, theories often ignore genetic biodiversity represented by intraspecific variability arising from indivdual diversity inside populations and communities. Yet, numerous studies have shown that (i) intraspecific variation is high [@Messier2010; @Vieilledent2010], (ii) intraspecific variation play an important role at population and community level [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @Albert2015; @Messier2010], (iii) intraspecific variation can answer paradox in theories of species coexistence [@Laughlin2012], and (iv) intraspecific variation is needed to understand maintenance of species coexistence [@chave_neutral_2004; @Chesson2000a; @Clark2007; @Clark2010; @Violle2012] and therefore is a cause of biodiversity existence.

Consequently, we want to include genetic diversity through a bottom-up study starting from indivdual to population instead of classical top-down studies going from communities to species and sometimes until individuals. Because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environement are ultimately based at the level of individuals, we want to discuss eco-evolutionary theories starting with individuals [@Violle2012]. We thus wish to discuss individual level diversity through ecology and evolution to participate to the question of biodiversity characteristics and causes. We want to use an integrative and dynamic model of the individual functionement in interaction with its population and environment through time coupled with a litterature review to explore this question.

# Model description

## Individual level

If we a consider a mature individual tree *A* (see figure 1A). It will be constituted of a genome with different genes ($G_1,...G_I$). Part of the genome will be expressed in the transcriptome depending on individual ontogeny and environmental conditions. **Look into this.** Then those transcripts will be responsible for the creation of molecules forming biochemistrial traits of the individual. This basic functional traits can be considered as primary traits. Interactions in individuals biochemistrial traits will then build individual physiological and morphological traits. All functional traits, among biochemistry, physiolgy and morphology, finally influence integrative traits represented by performance traits directing playing on individual fitness. Perfomance traits are growth, reproduction and survival. Fitness (**define fitness**) of the individual will then result in the balance of those three performance traits (**add example of opposite trade-offs**). But all those step resulting in individual fitness through genes, traits and performance are influenced by their local environment. Local environment is both abiotic (nutrients, water, light...) and biotic (competition, predation). And local environment interpaly with individuals processes at different levels. **E => G ?**. Local environment may change functional traits values with phenotypic plasticity (**Litterature**). **E => P ?**. Consequently local environment affect individual fitness.

## Population level

Now if we consider the same individual A inside its environment and its population (see figure 1B) with the environment presenting two habitats (blue and red), and the population two genotypes associated to each habitat (blue and red too). Once the indivdual will have reached maturity to reproduce, the first step will be mating with partners through pollen.

# Litterature review

## TO CLASSIFY

## Advocate for individual level

* "a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology" [@chave_neutral_2004]
* "Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes." [@Vieilledent2010]
* "Because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment are ultimately based at the level of the individual, it makes sense to build a theory of community ecology starting with individuals." [@Violle2012]

## Theory

* @Chesson2000a suggested two diversity maintenance mechanisms, the second being the stabilizing mechanisms: "if negative intraspecific interactions tend to be greater than intraspecific interactions"
* "Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ on average" [@Clark2010]
* "Consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species" [@Clark2010]
* "Just a variation among individuals is required to maintain species by natural selection, providing a means for adaptive evolution in response to many factors ... explaining why large number of intensely competitive species coexist" [@Clark2010]

## Observation

* "individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations" [@Vieilledent2010]

## Phenotypic plasticity

* "The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics." [@Vieilledent2010]
