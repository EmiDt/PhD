# Introduction

Characterizing biological diversity, or so-called biodiversity, and understanding its causes and consequences have been central to the development of ecology and evolution [@Messier2010]. Three simple questions arise from this statement: (1) what is biodiversity, (2) what is the cause of its existence, (3) and what are the consequences of its existence. Characterizing biodiversity is a *sine qua non* condition to embrace the two following questions. Once the biodiversity is characterised we can study its causes. But biodiversity is dynamic, so we can study its origin, maintenance, and future, or more generally how it evolves. Once biodiversity is characterised, we can also study consequences of its existence. But this is a different question which will not be addressed here despite a huge litterature around the question [@Cardinale2012; @diaz_biodiversity_2006; @Liang2016; @Loreau2000; @Naeem2002; @Oliver2015; @Yachi1999].

_**What is biodiversity ?**_

Biodiversity can be divided in three fundamental categories: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity encompass the range of terrestrial and aquatic environements found on earth classified into ecosystems. Ecosystems encompass both the biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Moreover, species diversity represents species in which are categorized the interacting organisms of the ecosystem. Species have been defined as groups of organims which are reproducing isolated from other such groups, protecting the integrity of their genotypes [@Mayr1996]. This reflects the biological species concept based on reproductive isolation. But species concepts and defintions have been largely debated [@Mayden1997], especially concerning plants, and many species concepts can be defined (phylogenetic, biological, ecological, morphological or genetic, see @DeQueiroz2007). However, indivduals presents variations in performance, phenotypes, and genes within species itself representing genetic diversity.

_**What is the cause of biodiversity existence ?**_

Earth present a lagre amount of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Among theim, the outstanding biodiversity of coral reefs and tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists [@connell_diversity_1978]. At the species level, different theories have been developed to explain the persistence of biodiversity. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001]. But numerous theories exists [@wright2002plant]. Still, theories often ignore genetic biodiversity represented by intraspecific variability arising from indivdual diversity inside populations and communities. Yet, numerous studies have shown that (i) intraspecific variation is high [@Messier2010; @Vieilledent2010], (ii) intraspecific variation play an important role at population and community level [@Albert2010; @Albert2011a; @Albert2015; @Messier2010], (iii) intraspecific variation can answer paradox in theories of species coexistence [@Laughlin2012], and (iv) intraspecific variation is needed to understand maintenance of species coexistence [@chave_neutral_2004; @Chesson2000a; @Clark2007; @Clark2010; @Violle2012] and therefore is one of the causes of biodiversity existence.

Consequently, we want to include genetic diversity through a bottom-up study starting from indivdual to population instead of classical top-down studies going from communities to species and sometimes until individuals. Because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environement are ultimately based at the level of individuals, we want to discuss eco-evolutionary theories starting with individuals [@Violle2012]. We thus wish to discuss individual level diversity through ecology and evolution to participate to the question of biodiversity characteristics and causes. We want to use an integrative and dynamic model of the individual functionement in interaction with its population and environment through time coupled with a litterature review to explore this question.

# Model description

If we a consider an individual tree *A* (see figure 1A). *A* is constituted of a genome with different genes ($G_1,...G_I$). Genes are expressed and result in phenotypic or functional traits ($T_1,...T_J$) among biochemistry, physiolgy and morphology. All functional traits finally influence integrative traits represented by performance traits ($F_1,...F_K$) which directly plays on individual fitness ($w$). But all those step resulting in individual fitness through genes, traits and performance are influenced by their local environment. 

Now if we consider the same individual *A* inside its environment and its population (see figure 1B) with the environment presenting two habitats (blue and red), and the population two genotypes associated to each habitat (blue and red). Once the indivdual will have reached maturity to reproduce, the first step will be mating with partners through pollen, in the limit of reproductive barriers with sometimes mating between genotypes (blue and red individuals). After mating, individuals will disperse seeds which will established or not in the two habitats. Finally once established tree will grow until maturity to mate again and reproduce, closing the cycle. The whole cycle through reproduction, survival and growth performance traits will be the core of selection on individual fitness responsible of evolution of our population.

## Genes

* Part of the genome will be expressed in the transcriptome depending on individual ontogeny and environmental conditions. **Look into this.** 

## Traits

* This basic functional traits can be considered as primary traits. Interactions in individuals biochemistrial traits will then build individual physiological and morphological traits.

## Performance and fitness

* Perfomance traits are growth, reproduction and survival. Fitness (**define fitness**) of the individual will then result in the balance of those three performance traits (**add example of opposite trade-offs**).

## Environment

* Local environment is both abiotic (nutrients, water, light...) and biotic (competition, predation)

## Genes to traits

* Then those transcripts will be responsible for the creation of molecules forming biochemistrial traits of the individual.

## Traits to performance

## Environement effect

* *On which level(s) is interacting the environment ?*
* Local environment may change functional traits values with phenotypic plasticity.

## Mating

* A first pre-zygotic barrier happens with all limits to individuals mating: (i) individuals maturity, (ii) flowering synchronization between individuals, (iii) common pollinator if needed, and (iv) distance reachability.
* Mating can happen between individuals of close but different species [@Cannon2015] resulting in the mating between the two genotypes in figure 1B.

## Seeds dispersion and establishment

* Seeds dispersal and establishment are related to individual reproduction and survival performance capacities.
* Seeds establishment will be limited by abiotic environment through environmental filtering, but we can imagine an hybrid due to mating with the second ecotype to established in the second ecotype thanks to genetic introgression.
* Seeds establishment will be limited by biotic environment through the Jansen-Conell hypothesis.

## Tree growth

## Conclusion

* Interaction between Performance (Ecology) and Selection (Evolution) through fitness

# Litterature review

*Litterature review is only here as a work in progress and will be integrated to the previous text structure.*

## TO CLASSIFY

* "The concept of dynamic species pools is underappreciated in community assembly." [cite Mittelbach et al, 2015]

* "Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation." [cite Siefert et Ritchie, 20016]

* "Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses." [cite Siefert et Ritchie, 20016]

* "These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses" [cite Siefert et Ritchie, 20016]

* "However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns." [cite Barabas et d'Andrea, 2016]

## Advocate for individual level

* "a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology" [@chave_neutral_2004]
* "Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes." [@Vieilledent2010]
* "Because interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment are ultimately based at the level of the individual, it makes sense to build a theory of community ecology starting with individuals." [@Violle2012]

## Theory

* @Chesson2000a suggested two diversity maintenance mechanisms, the second being the stabilizing mechanisms: "if negative intraspecific interactions tend to be greater than intraspecific interactions"
* "Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ on average" [@Clark2010]
* "Consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species" [@Clark2010]
* "Just a variation among individuals is required to maintain species by natural selection, providing a means for adaptive evolution in response to many factors ... explaining why large number of intensely competitive species coexist" [@Clark2010]
* "Traitspace can test for the effects of limiting similarity by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variation." [cite Laughlin et Laughlin, 2013]

## Observation

* "individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations" [@Vieilledent2010]

## Phenotypic plasticity

* "The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics." [@Vieilledent2010]
