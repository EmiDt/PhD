## Ecological genomics of niche exploitation and individual performance in tropical forest trees

The outstanding biodiversity of tropical rainforests has always fascinated ecologists  [@connell_diversity_1978]. Different theories have been developed to  to explain the persistence of different species in sympatry. Niche theory explains species coexistence depending on niche differences to limit competitive exclusion [@Weiher; @lortie_rethinking_2004-1], while neutral theory shows that maintenance of high diversity is possible even for functionally equivalent species, because of  stochastic life, death, reproduction and dispersal dynamics [@Hubbell2001].

However, odels of community dynamics cannot explain the maintenance of biodiversity in the long term because they consider all members of a species as equivalent, thus ignoring the component of within-species biodiversity [@Albert2011; @Chesson2000; @laughlin_predictive_2012; @Snell2014; @Bec2015]. Effectively, some studies argue that intraspecific variability is necessary for the  maintenance of species diversity in communities [@Chesson2000; @Clark2010]. 

On the other hand, few studies focused on specific microevolutionary processes at the origin of these hyper diverse ecosystems (Plana 2004, Pennington et al. 2006). Trees evolutionary patterns present a paradox: tree lineages maintain high diversity while keeping a low speciation rate (Petit & Hampe 2006). This paradox is related to tropical tree great size, longevity, and numerous seeds, along with large effective population [@Brown2004] outcrossing mating system and maintaining a strong gene flow [@Hamrick1992; @Nybom2004]. Thus, neutral processes maintain diversity over time by connecting species with high gene flow and large effective population, while adaptive processes lead to local adaptation on short times with an expected  genetic differentiation at the loci underlying heritable traits [@Howe2003; @LeCorre2003].

Therefore, intraspecific variability seems highly important in species rich ecosystems such as tropical forests [@TerSteege2013]. Indeed tropical forests present both clades with huge variation in varied habitats [@Brousseau2015], and closely related species living in sympatry frequently share alleles [@Gonzalez2009; @Parmentier2013]. Species that share alleles frequently can be considered as belonging  to species complexes, which largely share genetic variation because of hybridization of common ancestry but where divergent selection favours differential niche adaptation. 

Consequently, we want to investigate *Symphonia* and *Eschweilera* species complexes at the individual level to better understand the importance of intraspecific variation into species maintenance and diversification. We want to use genetic markers to characterize each individual and investigate the roles of environment and genotype in explaining individual functional traits, and ultimately, growth performance. We hope to relate genes to performance in individualsâ€™ specific environments to better predict growth at the individual level and understand the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in species complexes.
