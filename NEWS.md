# To Do

## In waiting

- Paracou gaps map of 1992 (both control and treatments) *@AurÃ©lie*

## Sampling

1. Symphonia characters to note and materials to collect

## Environments

1. Morphotype and Genotype association to environment (Water table, DEM and derivates)
1. Proxy of water table map with DEM

## Genetic

## Functional

## Growth

1. Growth models Go (ontogeny only)
1. Genetic effect on growth
1. Gap effect on Symphonia growth (Treatment, Gap maps, Lidar)

## Others

1. Volunteer/Intern sampling/functional traits
1. Define individuals to sample
1. CEBA/ATT fundings

## Questions

*To think of but not always meant to be explored.*

- Flowers ?
- Winners and loosers (dbh > 10) ?
- Water and/or light ?
- Mortality ?
