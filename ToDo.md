*The planning document on the drive might have outdated this document and they should be both actualized in parrallel*

# **Priorities**

1. **Concept document and scheme**

# Sampling

# Environments

1. Morphotype and Genotype association to environment (DEM and derivates)(GbS genotypes)
1. Proxy of water table map with DEM

# Genetic

# Functional

# Growth

1. Genetic effect on growth

# Questions

*To think of but not always meant to be explored.*

- Flowers ? (collect any flower remainsalong with GPS coordinates, or note nearby individuals, for possible SSR genotyping, so as to enable matching flower size with mother tree (for morpho character matrix)
- Mortality ?
