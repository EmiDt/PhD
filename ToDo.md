# Functional

# Growth

1. Growth models Go (ontogeny only)
1. Genetic effect on growth

# Others

1. Writting master 2 subject on *Symphonia* functional traits intracomplex variability

# In waiting

- Paracou gaps map of 1992 (both control and treatments) *@AurÃ©lie*

# Questions

*To think of but not always meant to be explored.*

- Flowers ? (collect any flower remainsalong with GPS coordinates, or note nearby individuals, for possible SSR genotyping, so as to enable matching flower size with mother tree (for morpho character matrix)
- Winners and loosers (dbh > 10) ? (Compare "young" vs. "old" cohorts for allele frequency differences: we can assume that selection is strongest at the early life stages, from plant establishment to sapling. Thus, individual with the largest dbh have undergone selection during their establishment at pre-industrial times, whereas the ones with the smallest dbh have undergone recent selection, in the last 30 years or so. This is not strictly winner vs. loosers, but establishment in pre-industrial vs. industrial times, where a climate change effect should already be noticeable).
- Water and/or light ?
- Mortality ?
